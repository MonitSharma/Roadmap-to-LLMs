# Notes on Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### Language Models
- A **language model** predicts and generates plausible language.
- Example: Autocomplete predicts the next word based on a sequence of tokens.
- Models estimate probabilities for words or sequences of words in context.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- LLMs are advanced versions of language models with increased scale and complexity.
- Capable of predicting probabilities for entire sentences, paragraphs, or documents.
- Enabled by improvements in **memory**, **dataset size**, **processing power**, and advanced architectures.

#### Examples of "Large":
- **BERT**: 110M parameters.
- **PaLM 2**: Up to 340B parameters.

## Transformer Architecture
- Introduced in 2017, the **Transformer** revolutionized language modeling with **self-attention**.
- **Encoders**: Convert input text into intermediate representations.
- **Decoders**: Transform intermediate representations into output text.
- Applications include translation (e.g., "I am a good dog" → "Je suis un bon chien").

### Self-Attention
- Mechanism that assigns importance to different tokens in the input.
- Example: "The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired." Self-attention helps determine whether "it" refers to "animal" or "street."

## Use Cases for LLMs
- Text generation, summarization, question answering, and classification.
- Emergent abilities include solving math problems and writing code.
- Applications:
  - Sentiment analysis.
  - Toxicity classification.
  - Generating image captions.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Costs and Infrastructure
- Training large models requires significant resources and time.
- Engineering challenges arise with models containing trillions of parameters.
- Mitigation strategies:
  - **Offline inference**: Reduce runtime costs.
  - **Distillation**: Create smaller, efficient versions of large models.

### Bias and Ethical Concerns
- Training on human language introduces biases in race, gender, religion, etc.
- Misuse and ethical concerns in deployment should be carefully managed.


Large language models represent significant advancements in AI but come with high costs and ethical concerns. As their capabilities expand, responsible development and deployment remain critical. For more information, explore resources like Google's Machine Learning Crash Course.
